* dplyr added with this, filter function, stats package also has filter function (overwritten by dplyr)

## Import datasets and clean up names of columns with janitor function
```{r}
"./datascience1/FAS_litters.csv"
 ## [1] "./datascience1/FAS_litters.csv"

litters_data =  read_csv(file = "./data_import_examples/FAS_litters.csv")
litters_data = janitor::clean_names(litters_data)

pups_data = read_csv(file = "./data_import_examples/FAS_pups.csv")
pups_data = janitor::clean_names(pups_data)
litters_data
pups_data
```
```{r}
pull(litters_data, group)
## Group is in data set, but r doesn't know about it directly
```

##Selecting
```{r}
view(litters_data)

##Selected group and litter_number variable
select(litters_data, group, litter_number)

#Selecting all of these things, and any column that starts with "pups" (helper function)
select(litters_data, litter_number, gd0_weight, starts_with("pups"))

#way you select matters, the columns show up in the direct order you call them
select(litters_data, litter_number, group, gd0_weight)

## Putting everything() calls the columns you ordered first and then everything after that
select(litters_data, litter_number, group, everything())

## If you don't want something put minus sign in front of it, here it's everything - group
select(litters_data, -group)

## Using a semi-colon tells it to include every column in between the two around it
select(litters_data, litter_number, gd0_weight:pups_born_alive)
```

##
```{r}

```
